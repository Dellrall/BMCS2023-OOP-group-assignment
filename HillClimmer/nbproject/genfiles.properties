# This file is used by a NetBeans-based IDE to track changes in generated files such as build-impl.xml.
# Do not edit this file. You may delete it but then the IDE will no longer track changes for the project.
# When the IDE generates the project, a copy of build-impl.xml is created in nbproject/build-impl.xml
# and this file is created. The IDE will not overwrite build-impl.xml if there have been changes
# between the current version and the version that was generated at the last project generation.
# The IDE will overwrite nbproject/build-impl.xml only when it is older than nbproject/project.xml
