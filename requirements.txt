                              *** IMPORTANT POINTS ***
===============================================================================

‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   ‚Ä¢ Each team's idea MUST BE DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE from other student teams
   ‚Ä¢ All students in the team MUST be involved in system development
   ‚Ä¢ Advanced OOP features are REQUIRED: polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation
   ‚Ä¢ Java interfaces encouraged for weak relationships between objects

üéØ MANDATORY CORE FUNCTIONS (ALL REQUIRED):
   ‚úì Add/register new customers
   ‚úì Add new vehicles to the system
   ‚úì Display available vehicles
   ‚úì Rent a vehicle to a customer
   ‚úì Return a rented vehicle
   ‚úì Calculate and display rental charges
   ‚úì Rental history

üíª IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS:
   ‚Ä¢ Console output (character-based) - ACCEPTABLE
   ‚Ä¢ Graphical User Interface (GUI) - ACCEPTABLE
   ‚Ä¢ No mark discrimination between display methods

üìã TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   ‚Ä¢ Java programming language (MANDATORY)
   ‚Ä¢ Object-oriented design with proper class definitions
   ‚Ä¢ Simulated environment for testing
   ‚Ä¢ Professional-level implementation

‚ö†Ô∏è  LEGAL/ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
   ‚Ä¢ NO copyrighted images if using GUI
   ‚Ä¢ Use own created images OR publicly available licensed images
   ‚Ä¢ Proper attribution for creative commons images
